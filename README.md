# pkgcraft-bash

Various bash plugins that leverage pkgcraft's C API instead of being forced to
maintain duplicate functionality such as version parsing and comparisons in
bash.

## Plugins

- **[ver_test][1]**: perform version comparisons

## Requirements

- **pkgcraft**: the C library and its related header file
- **bash**: plugins support must be enabled and development files should be available (.pc and headers)
